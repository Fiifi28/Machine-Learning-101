## <u>Exercise Numpy and Pandas </u>

### <u>QUESTIONS ON NUMPY</U>

 1. Create a numpy array that containers 20 elements, **(ie)** the elements should range from ``` 1,2,3,...,20``` 
  **i**. check the shape and 
  **ii**. dtype of the numpy array

<br>

2. **i**. Create a numpy array of a ``` 4 X 4 ``` Matrix         containing all ones 

    **ii**. Create a numpy array of a ``` 5 X 4 ``` Matrix containing all zeros 

    **iii**. Create a numpy array of a ``` 3 X 4 ``` Matrix containing all random numbers

<br>

3. Create a numpy array that containers 16 elements:
    **i**. reshape it to a ``` 3 x 3 ``` matrix
    **ii**. transpose the matrix 
    **iii**. and flatten the transpose matrix 


<br>

4. Create a numpy array that containers 18 elements:
    **i**. slice the elements from ``` 5 - 8 ``` (ie) include 8 as part of your slice, store the sliced elements into a array using any name you want and display that new array.

    **ii**. slice the elements from ``` 11 - 18 ``` (ie) excluding 18 as part of your slice, store the sliced elements into a array using any name you want and display that new array.

    **iii**. slice the elements from ``` 11 - 18 ``` (ie) using the negative index method and excluding 18 as part of your slice, store the sliced elements into a array using any name you want and display that new array.

### <u>QUESTIONS ON PANDAS</u> 

1. Manually create your own data using the python dictionary object. **(ie)** ``` data = {}```, the data should have at least 4 columns and 15 rows, and lastly your columns have at least one object and the rest should be numerical columns.

    **i**. Check the shape of the data 
    **ii**. Display the first 5 rows in dataset
    **iii**. Show some dtype infomation about your dataset
    **iv**. Show some statistical information about your dataset
    **v**. Using the pandas attribute show me all your columns.
    **vi**. Display the last 5 rows in dataset

<br>

2. Create a new dataset the contains 20 rows and 3 columns.``` columns = ["age", "weight", "height"] ``` and generate your own values for the dataset.
    **a**. Show some dtype infomation about your dataset
    **b**. Show some statistical information about your dataset
    **c**. Using the pandas attribute show me all your columns.
    **d**. Using your knowledge in python or you can search on the from the internet, ```create a simple BMI function``` to  calculate for the ```BMI``` and add the BMI to the columns making it four cloumns in total.

    **e**. Now that you have a new and a complete data i want to change all the columns name to upper case letter, any method you use to achieve the result it fine by me.

    **f**. from your new dataset you have i want to you to filter that data and get all the ``` BMI that are greater than 60 and all the height that are less than 40```.store into a new variable and display.

    **g**. Again using the same info above filter the ages that are ```greater than 50```

<br>

3. I want you to create two new dataset with the valriable names  sample_A and sample_B. please make sure the two dataset have one column in common and have at least 4 values in both data that are the same.
    **i**.  Create an inner join 
    **ii**. Create an outer join
    **iii**.Create a left join
    **iv**. Create a right join
